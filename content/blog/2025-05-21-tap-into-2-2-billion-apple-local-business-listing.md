## Setting Up Your Apple Maps Business Listing

Apple Business Connect, launched in January 2023, serves as the central hub for managing your Apple Maps business listing. With this, businesses of any size can show up on Apple services, much like they can with Google's Business Profile.

### Step 1: Navigate to Apple Business

To get started, go to the Apple Business Connect platform. Apple generally makes an automatic location place card for most businesses, though these often contain limited or old information.

### Step 2: Create or Use an Apple ID

You must have an Apple ID to submit your listing. If you haven’t set up a password, Apple asks you to make one before you can go further. It is recommended to make a separate Apple ID if you use Apple services for business needs.

### Step 3: Select Your Business Type

Select the option that matches your business on the next screen: small business, enterprise or a third-party overseeing listings for clients.

### Step 4: Find or Create Your Location Place Card

Search for your business by name. If Apple has already generated a listing, select it rather than creating a duplicate. If your business doesn't appear, you'll need to create a new listing with basic information.

### Step 5: Add Business Details

When you have the basic info, enter the language your business uses, your display name, its main category and the URL to your website. Make sure you give customers enough facts to answer their questions properly.

### Step 6: Complete Verification

You may verify ownership within minutes by calling or it might take up to 5 days by showing documents. When a phone number is registered, a PIN code is sent and for document verification, you have to submit official business documents online.
