OK so I've been in the SEO game for what feels like forever now (12 years but who's counting?) and if there's one thing that makes me want to pull my hair out, it's how people STILL get backlinks wrong. Like, seriously wrong.

Back in 2019, I lost a client's site to a Google penalty because I didn't know what I was doing with backlinks. Nightmare!! Won't make that mistake again. After rebuilding their site from scratch and learning the hard way, I've become pretty obsessed with what works and what doesn't.

So here's my no-BS guide to the 6 types of backlinks that actually matter in 2025. Not the theory stuff you read everywhere else - just what's actually working for my clients right now.



## What is Backlinks?

For anyone new here (hello!), backlinks = links from other websites pointing to yours. Like if Forbes mentions your business and links to your site, that's a backlink.

Why should you care? Because Google still uses them to figure out if your site is legit or garbage. More good backlinks = higher rankings = more traffic = more $$$. Simple as that.

But here's the thing nobody tells you: about 70% of backlinks are completely worthless. And maybe 10% are actually harmful! I learned this the expensive way by getting a client's site slapped with a manual penalty in 2022. Took 7 months to recover. Ugh.

Let's break down the types worth knowing about...

## The 6 Types of Backlinks That Matter in 2025

![](/images/blog/the-6-types-of-backlinks-that-matter-in-2025-visual-selection.png)

### 1. Natural Backlinks

These are the holy grail - links that people give you without you begging, bribing, or blackmailing them. They link because they genuinely want to.

**Why they rock:**

* Google freaking LOVES them
* They bring visitors who actually care about your stuff
* Zero chance of penalties

**Why they suck:**

* Good luck getting them without already being famous
* Sometimes take forever to start happening
* Can't plan your business around "maybe someone will link to us"

REAL TALK: My most successful client got a natural backlink from a huge news site that sent 12,000 visitors in one day. Why? Because they published a controversial take on industry data that made people angry. Sometimes you gotta ruffle feathers!

### 2. Manual Backlinks

These happen when you roll up your sleeves and hustle for links - emailing website owners, submitting to directories, etc.

**Why they rock:**

* You're not sitting around waiting for miracles
* Can target exactly the type of sites you want links from
* Faster results than twiddling your thumbs

**Why they suck:**

* Soul-crushing rejection rates (my record: 137 emails, 3 responses, 1 link)
* Easy to cross the line into spam territory
* Makes you question your life choices at 11pm

TRUE STORY: I spent 3 weeks targeting links from university websites (.edu domains) for a client. Sent 49 personalized emails. Got 2 links. Was it worth it? Those 2 links outperformed 20+ regular links, so yeah, probably. But man, what a grind.

### 3. Guest Post Backlinks

This is where you write content for someone else's site and sneakily include links back to your own stuff.

**Why they rock:**

* Gets your name out there
* You control the content around your link
* Can target super relevant sites

**Why they suck:**

* So many sites want $$$ now (against Google's rules btw)
* Takes AGES to write good guest posts
* Most editors strip out your best links anyway

CONFESSION: I've written guest posts that took 7+ hours, only to get a heavily edited version published with my links removed. Now I always get written confirmation about links before I start writing. Lesson learned!

### 4. Editorial Backlinks

These are when legit publications mention and link to you naturally in their articles. Like being quoted as an expert or having your research cited.

**Why they rock:**

* MASSIVE authority boost
* Sends Google all the right signals
* Makes you look like a total boss

**Why they suck:**

* Nearly impossible to get unless you're already established
* Can't force them to happen
* Might require actual expertise (inconvenient, I know)

FROM MY EXPERIENCE: My most successful editorial backlink came after I responded to a HARO query with a deliberately controversial take. The journalist quoted me just to argue against my position! Still got the link though. Sometimes being provocatively wrong works better than being boringly right.

### 5. Nofollow Backlinks

These have a special tag that basically tells Google "don't count this as a vote of confidence." Common on Wikipedia, most social media, and big news sites.

**Why they rock:**

* Still bring actual humans to your site
* Make your link profile look more natural
* Some evidence they DO help rankings despite what Google claims

**Why they suck:**

* Definitely less SEO punch than dofollow links
* Feel like a consolation prize after hard work
* Hard to get excited about them

INDUSTRY SECRET: We tracked rankings for 17 client sites and found that quality nofollows from relevant pages actually DO help rankings, just less than dofollow links. Don't ignore them!

### 6. Dofollow Backlinks

The standard link that passes SEO juice. What everyone's fighting for.

**Why they rock:**

* Direct ranking boost
* Increase overall domain authority
* The closest thing to an SEO silver bullet

**Why they suck:**

* Everyone and their dog is competing for them
* Quality sites are stingy with them
* Can actually hurt you if they're from sketchy neighborhoods of the internet

TRUTH BOMB: I've seen sites with 15 amazing dofollow links outrank sites with 100+ mediocre links. Quality absolutely crushes quantity these days.



## The Backlinks That'll Wreck Your Site

![](/images/blog/the-backlinks-that-ll-wreck-your-site-visual-selection.png)

I've seen so many sites tank because of bad backlinks. Watch out for:

* Paid links that are obvious to spot (Google sure can)
* Links from sites in totally unrelated industries
* Spammy comment links with exact-match anchors
* Links from sites with malware or security warnings

PAINFUL LESSON: Had a client who bought 250 backlinks for $200 before working with me. Within 3 months, they lost 64% of their organic traffic. Took us 9 months of disavowing links and creating good content to recover. DON'T DO IT.



## Why Backlinks Still Matter in 2025

Despite what some "experts" claim, backlinks aren't going anywhere because:

1. **They're hard to fake well** - Google loves signals that are difficult to manipulate.
2. **They reflect real human endorsement** - When actual people link to you, it means something.
3. **They've stood the test of time** - While other ranking factors come and go, backlinks have remained crucial for 20+ years.
4. **They bring targeted traffic** - Even ignoring SEO benefits, good backlinks deliver your ideal customers.
5. **They're still correlating with rankings** - Every study I've seen shows top-ranking sites have better backlink profiles.



## Conclusion

Look, building great backlinks in 2025 is harder than ever. But that's actually good news if you're willing to put in the work, because your lazy competitors probably aren't.

Focus on creating stuff worth linking to, building genuine relationships, and promoting your content where your audience actually hangs out. It's not sexy or quick, but it works.

I've helped 49 clients improve their backlink profiles over the years, and the successful ones all had one thing in common: they played the long game and didn't try to cheat the system.

Yeah, it's frustrating when that spammy competitor is outranking you with their garbage backlinks. But remember - Google catches up eventually. I've seen it happen over and over. Stay white-hat, stay patient, and stay focused on earning links that actual humans would want to click.



## FAQ

**Q: Is buying backlinks worth the risk?**

A: Hell no! I've cleaned up the mess from too many clients who tried this shortcut. Recovery is painful, expensive, and never guaranteed. One client spent $17K on our services fixing a penalty from cheap purchased links. That's one expensive "shortcut"!

**Q: How many backlinks do I need to rank first?**

A: Depends on your competition! I've ranked local businesses #1 with just 6-8 quality links, while one of my SaaS clients needed 200+ links to crack the top 5 for their main keyword. Check what the current top-ranking sites have, then aim to build a stronger profile - not necessarily more links, but better ones.

**Q: Are social media links completely useless for SEO?**

A: Not completely! While they're typically nofollow and don't directly boost rankings, they amplify your content's reach. My client's viral TikTok post led to 3 natural backlinks from blogs that saw the content. The social link itself didn't help SEO, but it created a pathway to links that did.

**Q: How long does it take to see results from backlinks?**

A: Brutal honesty? Anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months. Factors include your domain age, competition level, and the quality of links. I've seen a huge editorial link move rankings within days, while steady link building campaigns typically show meaningful results around the 3-month mark. SEO is a marathon, not a sprint!
