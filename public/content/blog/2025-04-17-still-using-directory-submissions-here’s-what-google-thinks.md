If you are an SEO or digital marketing expert, then you might have had directory uploads as one of the topics. Certainly, over the years, you are already aware of directory submissions as one of the best techniques to acquire backlinks and, hence, attract traffic to your site. But do directory submissions still have a place in the contemporary SEO landscape? Most importantly, what is Google's view on this matter?

Let us go straight to the point.

## **What Are Directory Submissions?**

Directory submissions are the action of listing your site in directories that are divided by different subject areas. It was a fast way for users to find what they were looking for on the web. When the directory format was still around, they were incredibly useful for people on the internet.

Nonetheless, directories have become less useful as the Internet has expanded. Search engines like Google became more sophisticated through algorithm changes that made directory submissions almost ineffective.

## **Google's Stance on Directory Submissions**

Over the years, Google has drastically changed its views concerning directory uploads. In the first place, the directory submissions did help the crawlers of Google in finding new sites. However, with the update of Penguin and Panda, things changed fundamentally for Google.

These days, Google doesn't support directory submissions that are overly spammy and excessive, taking them for manipulative ranking attempts. Google's official guidelines warn against using directory submissions only for artificial rank improvements. The current guideline encourages content that produces links genuinely because of its quality.

If directory uploads are a priority in your SEO strategy, it's high time for you to rethink your strategy.

## **Why Directory Submissions Might Hurt Your Website**

When your directory uploads target poor-quality or spam directories, it, in turn, can hurt your website's rank. Google penalises sites where manipulative linking is done. By submitting to irrelevant directories, their penalties or their deletion might happen.

Furthermore, users prefer using search engines or social media nowadays instead of directories, which hardly ever bring users. Thus, spending time on directories will not have a significant return.

## **Are Directory Submissions Completely Obsolete?**

Of course, directory submissions may not be totally dead, however, their worth has dramatically lowered. Certain directories like Yelp, Yellow Pages, and sector-specific directories still have some significance, if they are credible.

Also, a selective approach to directory submissions through reliable sources can enhance your local SEO and help customers find your business more easily.

## **How to Identify Quality Directories**

* **Traffic Quality:** Cab that generates real user traffic, not bots.

## Effective Alternatives to Directory Submissions

To experience better SEO results, you need to take into account these alternatives:

* **Guest Posting:** Write content for reputed and relevant industry sites to attain backlinks online.
* **Content Marketing:** Make sure that you create and promote compelling content that people will naturally link to.

* **Social Media:** Use platforms efficiently to create organic traffic and thus, increase site visibility.
* **Influencer Collaboration:** Collaborate with influencers from your niche to broaden your reach and earn authoritative backlinks.

These strategies not only stick to Google's suggested approaches but also remain benefiting the firm in the long term without the need to manage poorly dished out directory submissions.

## **Google's Evolving Algorithm and Future Trends**

Google constantly modifies its algorithms by prioritizing content of better quality, relevance, user experience, and mobile compatibility. Directory submissions no longer match these priorities.

In the future, Google will more likely promote the high-value content and bitterly hurt the obsolete ways of advertising. In order to keep on succeeding in the business, you should stick to the user-first approach and avoid chasing outdated link-building techniques.

## **Final Thoughts**

Although directory submissions aren't complete relics, their usefulness is minimal today. Due to the fact that constantly earned links are what Google wants the most, SEO approaches should be built around the idea of content quality and genuine interaction with audiences over any kind of "old school" directory submissions. 

If you are still heavily embargoing directory uploads, then the time is ripe for you to shift towards more efficient, Google-friendly SEO strategies.
