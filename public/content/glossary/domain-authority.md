Domain Authority (DA) is scored on a scale from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater authority and ranking potential. While not directly used by Google in its ranking algorithm, DA serves as a comparative metric to evaluate the strength of websites relative to each other.

Factors that influence Domain Authority include:

- Number and quality of backlinks
- Age of the domain
- Site structure and technical SEO elements
- Content quality and relevance
- Social signals and brand mentions

Improving Domain Authority requires a comprehensive SEO strategy focused on earning high-quality backlinks, creating valuable content, and ensuring technical optimization of your website.

Domain Authority should not be confused with Page Authority, which predicts the ranking potential of specific pages rather than entire domains.
