Also known as "inbound links" or "incoming links," backlinks are hyperlinks that direct from one website to another. They are a fundamental aspect of search engine optimization (SEO) because search engines like Google interpret backlinks as indicators of content quality and relevance.

When a website links to your page, it's essentially vouching for your content. The more high-quality backlinks your site has, the more likely search engines are to rank it higher in search results.

Not all backlinks are created equal. Links from authoritative, relevant websites carry more weight than those from low-quality or unrelated sites. This is why modern SEO strategies focus on earning quality backlinks rather than simply accumulating large quantities of links.
